# Elementary Lattice Dynamics
- Lattice Vibrations and Phonons : 
	- Linear Mono-atomic and
	- Diatomic Chains. 
- Acoustical and Optical Phonons. 
- Qualitative Description of the Phonon Spectrum in Solids. 
- Dulong and Petitâ€™s Law, 
- Einstein and Debye theories of specific heat of solids (qualitative only). 
- $T^3$ law


## Discuss in detail the lattice vibration of one-dimensional line of atoms

### One-Dimensional  Line of atoms
- 1 D chain of identical atoms each of mass m, connected by Hooke's law springs
