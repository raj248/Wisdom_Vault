I. ABOUT


+ABOUT HARVEST MOON: Friends of Mineral Town+
 Created by: NATSUME

Harvest Moon is the only farming game in the world. Friends of Mineral Town
offers a breath of fresh air to gamers. It's fun and you can play it for
months and never get everything in the game. It's somewhat similar to an RPG
and the Sims.

You can grow crops, buy and sell things, go fishing, make friends, get a
girlfriend, get married, have a family, expand your farm and loads more stuff!
There are even great festivals which you can attend throughout all four
seasons!

One set back is that this game requires loads of patience (which I have) so
if you have A.D.D.** or something, you might wanna go cheat (Hey! Even
someone as patient as me do it!) **Attention Deficit Disorder...you fool...


+About Me+

Hi! My name's Gwendy (not that anyone cares). I'm a girl, and as you can
see, I'm an absolute fan of Harvest Moon games, particularly friends of
Mineral Town. This is my first ever game guide and I never really thought
I'd make one but I just got so hooked in the series. I also saw that some
guides don't provide as much infos so I decided to make my own. I studied
hard and found some neato tricks that I would like to share with
everyone else.

Harvest Moon first came to the SNES Consoles and GB Color consoles even then,
I couldn't stop playing. Until that is, Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town
came to GBA. I knew I just gotta grab it and when I did, I got hooked. And so
comes this guide. I hope this will help you. It's my first game guide so
go easy on me!

Oh, just to inform you. I didn't think people would ask more stuff about me,
so I decided to add in some stuff. I'm a Filipina, born and raised in
Mindanao, Philippines. I can speak fluent Bisaya, Tagalog and English.
I was born on July 30, 1985. I've been recently hired as a cartoonist and I am
also a budding writer, with my first novel, "Harlem Nights", being considered
for publication. I am currently writing my next novel, with the working
title of "Pearl of the Red Sun".

III. BEGINNING


+Starting the Game+

Click start. Enter your name. Enter your Birthday. Enter you farm's name. Enter
your dog's name and you're all set!


+Prologue+

You start as a young man (maybe 18-20 yrs old), visiting an old neglected farm.
You are speechless by the desertion and you ponder on your thoughts when a man
comes and yells at you for standing around there (after all, you are a
stranger). You explain that you're looking for an old man who lived in that
farm. The man tells you that he's the mayor of the town and has been looking
over the farm after that old farmer died. You are saddened by the news and the
mayor asks if you were the old farmer's friend. You say you are. You explain
that when you were little, your parents took you for a visit to Mineral Town.
Somehow, you got lost wound up in the farm, where you meet the old man. He
invited you and your parents to stay at the farm since he doesn't have a
family and is quite lonely. You have loads of fun in the farm as well as
in town. You also make a new friend(a little girl). When it came time for you
to leave, you and the farmer promised to write to each other constantly.
The little girl also bids you goodbye and tells you to come back some day.
Years later, you return since you wondered why the old man didn't answer your
letters anymore. The mayor, whose name is Thomas, then announces that the old
man has left the farm to you (he asks your name first of course).
And so begins your life in Mineral Town.

________________________________________________________________________________

IV. TOOLS & ACTIONS:

Press START and go to RUCKSACK MENU. Select tool/item.
Press B to use tool/item.


+Basic Tools & Actions+

1.) Chop Branches/Wood
    Tool: Axe (free)

2.) Break Rocks/Boulders
    Tool: Hammer (free)

3.) Cut Grass/Weeds/Plants/Crops
    Tool: Sickle (free)

4.) Till Ground (for planting or searching buried items)
    Tool: Hoe (free)

5.) Water Plants
    Tool: Watering Can (free)

6.) Fishing/Angling
    Tool: Fishing Rod (free from Zack)


+Other Tools+ (buy these from Saibara the blacksmith)

Brush = brush cows, sheep & horse to increase affection
Milker = used for milking cows
Shears = used to cut wool from sheep


+Upgradable Tools+

Upgraded tools are tools which are much more powerful and much more helpful
around the farm. There are six upgradable tools: axe, hammer, sickle, hoe,
watering can and fishing rod. First things you'll need are the right ores and
money. You can find the ores in the Spring Mine (cave near hotspring) by
breaking the rocks with your hammer.

*Ore Locations:

1.)Copper   = Level 1 & Lower
2.)Silver   = Level 1 & Lower
3.)Gold     = Level 3 & Lower
4.)Mystrile = Level 7 & Lower
5.)Mythic   = Level 60 & Lower (discussed later)


+How to Upgrade+

Go to Saibara, the blacksmith(he's a grumpy old man who lives in the first
house you see when going to town from the main entrance of your farm).
Bring the ore you want your tool to be upgraded with and of course, the tool
you want to have upgraded. Make sure you have the money too. It'll take a few
days for him to finish a tool, depending on the ore but it usually
takes 2-3 days.

*Upgrading Costs:

1.)Copper   = 1,000 G
2.)Silver   = 2,000 G
3.)Gold     = 3,000 G
4.)Mystrile = 4,000 G
5.)Mythic   = 50,000G (discussed later)

+Using Upgraded Tools+

Upgraded tools require more power than your previous normal tools. To harness
that power, hold B and let go. The higher the upgrade, the longer it will need
for you to hold the B button. If it doesn't work the first time, you'll have to
do it again.

MAJOR TIP:
If you want to save money, you can wait until all tools can be upgraded for
Mystrile. You can see this by pressing SELECT to go to the MAIN MENU.
Press LEFT or RIGHT until you reach a TOOLS GRAPH, where you can see as to
what ore your tool can be upgraded to. You can also hang out by the hotspring
and use the tool several times until you get it to be upgraded for Mystrile.
Once you turn blue, just take a dip in the hotspring for 1-2 hours(game time).
Get out and start using the tool again. Jumping to Mystrile saves on the money
since it's only 4000G upgrade per tool unlike the normal step-by-step upgrading,
which can cost up to 10,000G per tool! And to think you have 6 upgradable tools!


+Using Items+

Like the tools, you can also use some items (seeds, medicine, magic medicine).
To do this, select an item from the RUCKSACK MENU and equip it. Press B.


+Eating Items+

Food items of course, can be eaten (while drinks can be drank). To do this,
select a food item in the RUCKSACK MENU and equip it. Once you have it in your
hands, hold L while pressing B or press them both at the same time. (L+B)


+Special Tools+

There are 3 particular types of special tools which are several times more
powerful than Mystrile Tools. These are the Cursed Tools, Blessed Tools and the
Mythic Tools.

<<Cursed Tools>>

These are really powerful tools which you can find on certain levels of the
Winter/Lake Mine. To acquire these, you have to dig up on the floor until you
eventually find it. Note that when you equip these, it won't come off.
The only way to remove it is to have the curse lifted by Carter at
the church. Also, cursed tools suck up a lot of stamina.

Tool Name:		Where to get:	How to Bless:

C.Fishing Rod	Level 29		Use 225 times
C.Hoe			Level 39		Have Carter bless it 10 times
C.Axe			Level 49		Use 225 times
C.Hammer		Level 59		Equip 10 days straight
C.Watering Can	Level 69		Bless 10 times
C.Sickle		Level 79		Equip 10 days straight

TIP: For cursed tools that need to be used 225 times, you can do this during a
     festival since you NEVER collapse during a festival. Make sure you're in
     the venue.
     Also, for those that needed to be equipped 10 days STRAIGHT, that's
     exactly what you have to do so you can only gather stuff until the 10
     days is over. DO NOT HAVE CARTER REMOVE THE CURSED TOOL at any point in
     time until the 10 days is over. It's best you enlist the help of the
     harvest sprites.

<<Blessed Tools>>

These are tools whose curse has been lifted. Meaning, they were once your
cursed tools. The obvious advantages are that they don't suck up as much
stamina and you can remove them whenever you like.


<<Mythic Tools>>

These are the most powerful tools in the game and they suck up less stamina
than the blessed tools. Requirements are a TRUCKLOAD of money, all 6 blessed
tools and a Mythic stone for the tool you want to make Mythic. You can get the
Mythic stone by going to the Spring Mine and digging around level 60 and
some lower. These ores will only appear once you have all your cursed tools
turned to blessed tools.

Want the easy way out? Go to the MAKING MONEY Section under the GOLD-DIGGER
chapter and check out the Mythic Money tip (needs emulator). Yes, you can get
the Mythic stones through there without all the trouble of digging up in mines
where the possibility of getting one is very slim. Also, if you follow that
Mythic Money tip, you don't have to have all 6 of the blessed tools.
Just have enough money and Mythic stones to use for upgrading. The cheats are
provided in the later part of this guide.

Get around 24 mythic stones from the H.Goddess Rock-Paper-Scissors game in your
Vacation House/Town Cottage. That's four for each tool. Why? One is for
upgrading while the other 3 you can ship. That's 60,000G all in all since one
upgrade to Mythic costs 50,000G. That way, you earn an extra 10,000G per tool.
Great way to make money! That means the upgrading is practically free!
It's like Saibara's paying you 10,000G to get your tool upgraded to Mythic!
(Mwahahahaha! Revenge on the old fart! Hehehe...)

Want the even EASIER way out? There are cheats in the BREAKING THE CODES
section where you can have all 6 mythic tools even at the beginning
of the game! Cool, huh?

VIII. PREPARING YOUR FARM:


+Preparing the Land+

The farm has really been neglected for a long long time. That means a ton of
work for you. Here are some things you may have to do.

1.) Break boulders (upgrade your hammer 'til Mystrile or Gold)
2.) Break/remove rocks (your current hammer can break small rocks)
3.) Chop large tree trunks (upgrade your axe 'til Mystrile or Gold)
4.) Chop/remove branches (your current axe can break small rocks)
5.) Remove weeds (cutting with a sickle is good, but it takes stamina)

Yes, you may have to do a lot of upgrades before you can get your farm ready.
I suggest you finish upgrading your tools and preparing at least 1/4 or 1/6
of your land area before you start planting. Me, I finished all the
preparations in 8 days by working non-stop. Just take a dip in the hot springs
to rejuvenate. Don't have money for upgrading your tools? Check out the
MAKING MONEY section in the lower part of the guide.


+Planting Crops+

Once you have prepared the land, it's time to plant your crops. Buy seeds from
the Supermarket on the northern part of town or from Won (Zack's House).
Till your land with your HOE (if you're playing the first time, you'll very
likely find a POWER BERRY).
 _ _ _
|_|_|_|
|_|_|_|
|_|_|_|

Yup, a 3x3 square since that's the maximum perimeter per bag of seeds.
Refer to this as one patch. You'll also have to make sure that your other
patches aren't as close. That way, you can still water and harvest your crops.
For a more organized farm, this is my suggestion:

- = Crop
V = Grass

---VVVVVVVVV---VVVVVVVVV
---VVVVVVVVV---VVVVVVVVV
---VVVVVVVVV---VVVVVVVVV
VVV---VVVVVVVVV---VVVVVV
VVV---VVVVVVVVV---VVVVVV
VVV---VVVVVVVVV---VVVVVV
---VVVVVVVVV---VVVVVVVVV  As you can see, I have the crops and grass in
---VVVVVVVVV---VVVVVVVVV  alternate portions so that I can easily harvest and
---VVVVVVVVV---VVVVVVVVV  water my crops. It may not be as good as others, but
VVV---VVVVVVVVV---VVVVVV  it looks prettier.

---VVVVVVVVV---VVVVVVVVV
---VVVVVVVVV---VVVVVVVVV
---VVVVVVVVV---VVVVVVVVV


+Fencing it Up+

Just like the first Harvest Moon game, you can put up fences to protect your
farm against wild dogs. I don't really bother with these though. Not only is
it  a waste of time and lumber, you have to maintain it: taking it down when
it rots and replacing it. Sure, your animals will be safe, but who says you
have to let your animals out all the time? I myself keep my animals only in
my barn and I still end up with ten hearts (though it does take longer to get
this). But if you want your sheep and cows outside all the time to get more
wool and milk, build the fence. You can also just let your dog out. Try
letting him out once a wild dog is out. It's fun to watch!

To make a fence, simply take some lumber from your woodbin and put it on your
land. NOT THE GRASSY PART! The land you have to till. You can return the
lumber if you like by picking it up and returning it to the woodbin.

An advantage of getting your animals out is that you don't need to feed
them (if you have mature grass in the fenced area). Another, is that their
affection for you will rise quicker. Also, if they spend 600+ game hours
outside, they'll eventually produce (P)products and on occassion,
(X)products, which both sell for a lot of money. Just get your animals in
during bad weather, as they won't produce anything and they'll hate you.

And don't believe the myth that a rotten fence works as well as the good
fence. Once your fence rots, a wild dog CAN ENTER the area and scare your
animals. I saw this myself and had to whack it with a hammer. Always replace
rotting fences to prevent this. And don't be tempted to use the Golden Lumber!

+Plants+

These are some plants which you can...er...plant in your farm!
Most of these are flowers to...beautify your farm and all.
Also, some can be shipped! There's really not much purpose for this
other than beautification or if you want the flowers to be closer so
you can quickly give 'em to a girl you like. Oh, and some flowers
rejuvenate your stamina. I plant a lot of flowers and found that it
takes longer for me to pass out. That's just me so I dunno about you.
And I don't know which flowers rejuvenate you so please don't ask me.
I recommend buying these if you're rich enough. The only important thing
to buy here is GRASS for your animals. You'll need to water your flowers
so their growth won't be stunted.

X. FISHERY

Fishing is one of the many ways you can earn money in this game. To fish,
you'll of course, need a fishing rod. Just go to Zack's house. You'll see an
event wherein he gives you the fishing rod for free (see CHARACTER EVENTS).
You can then start fishing. Of course, you'll have to upgrade your rod to
catch the bigger fishes.

The fishing rod is considered as one of the hardest things to upgrade (see
TOOLS GRAPH in your EARNINGS MENU) since it can take a while. The best you
can do is stand by the Hot Springs and press B over and over again. Once
you turn blue, jump in the hotsprings to recuperate. I once sacrificed a day's
worth just to have my fishing rod jump upgrade to mystrile.
**For more info on the Fishing rod, see TOOLS (scroll up).
***Note that for rod levels, you need at least that to catch the specified fish


+River Fishes+

These are fishes you can find, where else, in the river! There are two parts:
Upstream, which is the river connected to Mother's Hill Lake, and Downstream,
which are the rivers found in the town (Poultry, Yodel and your Farm).

Yup! The site of the beautiful Harvest Goddess Falls and the "shrine" to the
Harvest Goddess. Other than offering stuff, you can fish here as well. Just

XI. MINING BUSINESS:

I dunno if this was the source of Mineral Town's name, but it's in the mines
where you can find minerals and ores which are very important in the game.
There are two mines: Spring Mine and the Winter/Lake Mine.
Here's a list of the mines and what can be found in them. You'll need your
hoe to dig up the ground and your hammer to break the rocks. You may also want
to get some stamina recovering items like black grass (which you can dig up in
mines, eat immediately)or if you want to go deep down, you can buy BODIGIZERXL
and TURBOJOLTXL from the Clinic. Use these wisely. The best item to use
however, is the Elli Leaves.

NOTE: These can be found at random so don't blame me if you can't find it.
	Careful not to go up the stairs immediately 'coz you'll go back to the
      surface. If you left your basket, you'll get it back in 2-3 days w/ the
      contents still intact.

expensive product. There are three makers in this game:

To get a maker, go to Saibara, the blacksmith and have him make one for you.
The requirements are as follows:

- fully expanded chicken coop and/or barn

It's expensive, I know. But well worth it once you have the gold eggs,
gold wool and gold milk 'coz it sells for more and it lasts a lifetime.

XIII. GOLD-DIGGER:


+Making Money+

If you're just starting off on the game and have not yet upgraded or planted
anything in your farm, here are some ways to make quick bucks.
NOTE: Cheat codes are provided in the later part of the guide.

1.) 250,000G in one week (needs vba emulator)
    - During the first five days of spring, the H.Goddess will have a
      New Year's game show where you'll have to guess if the number is higher
      or lower. Just surf the channels by going to your TV, press the B button
      and use the directional buttons to locate the H. Goddess show
     (try pressing the RIGHT button constantly). Play the New Year's Game Show.
      Save game state(Shift+F1) then guess. If you get it wrong, hit F1 and it
      will take you back to before you got the answer wrong. Just keep trying
      until you get it right. Play until 70 wins to get the Pirate Treasure,
      which is worth 10,000G. Play 5 times(since the show runs 5 times a day)
      and you get 50,000G a day, which is 250,000G in 5 days. Sure, it may get
      monotonous, but if you want quick bucks, this is the way to do it.
      You can also try for 25,000G a day or 125,000G in five days by winning
      until 60 to get the Fish Fossil worth 5000G. Another one would be for
      10,000G a day or 50,000G in 5 days by winning until 10 to get the
      Relaxation Tea Leaves worth 2000G. Just remember to play the game 5
      times a day.

2.) Free Money
    - I dunno why I named this that. It's mostly 'coz you get these money
      making items for free in places in town. Gather as many medicinal herbs
      as you can 'coz they sell quite well. Fishes are great sources of money
      too but you'll need to upgrade your pole to get bigger fishes.
      Mushrooms, esp. poisonous ones, sell a lot. Digging in the mines also
      helps. There's also honey every morning at the tree in your farm.
      If you turn blue, simply go to sleep, go to your bath or dip in the
      hotspring for a few hours.

3.) Non-stop Mine Digging
    - Dig in the mines (preferably Winter Mine) and fill your basket and
      rucksack with expensive minerals. Dig up as much gold coins as you can
      too(which doesn't take a slot in your rucksack and is instantly added to
      your invoice)until you turn blue. Then, go to hotspring and dip for
      2-3 hours(game time)before going back to the mine and digging up again
     (empty your rucksack first by putting items in your shelf)

4.) Horse Race Gamble
    - During the Spring and Fall Horse Festivals, place your bets and win lots
      of medals. Exchange the medals for broaches, which sells for 2,000G each
      (necklaces cost the same but it takes 20 medals so broaches, which
      takes only 18, costs less but sells for the same price). Fill up your
      rucksack and your basket. You can even carry an extra one in your hands.
      WARNING: If you entered the festival with your horse and won for the
      first time, you must not have anything in your hands or else you won't
      get the Power Berry.

5.) Crop Madness
    - In spring, plant cabbages (250G a piece) and lots of turnips (prepare for
      busy weeks since it grows very fast)
    - In summer, plant pineapples (500G a piece), preferably 8 patches.
      Buy pineapple seeds from Won during spring so you can plant it as early
      as the first day of summer. That way, you can harvest twice since it
      takes 20 days for these money-making babies to grow.
    - In Fall, plant Sweet Potatoes. Lots and lots of it! You can even make
      this the exclusive crop for your farm (at least during the season).
      It grows fast and costs a lot (120G a piece). Get ready for busy weeks
      'coz you're gonna need a lot of time harvesting everything

6.) Non-stop Fishing
    - During the Summer Beach Festival, you can fish without wasting time or
      stamina. Just bring your basket with you and fish lots of fish.
      If you have the blessed or mythic fishing rod, you can fill your basket
      with pirate treasure. Another festival wherein you can do this is the
      Summer Fireworks Festival.
      WARNING!!! If you already have a wife, DO NOT FISH DURING FESTIVALS!
      If you do, her affection rate for you WILL drop.

7.) Mythic Money (needs vba emulator)
    - You can only get this in the later parts of the game, when you have the
      Vacation House. You can use cheats to earn loads of cash and get the
      V.House early. Anyway, once in the V. House, you get a T.V with 3
      different channels. Every Saturday, the Harvest Goddess plays the Rock-
      Paper-Scissors game with you. Just like tip#1, save game state(Shift+F1)
      then guess. If you get it wrong, hit F1 and it will take you back to
      before you got the answer wrong. Just keep trying until you get
      it right. Play until 40 wins to get the Mythic Stone, which is worth
      20,000G! If you don't want to use it for upgrades, you can ship it.
      Problem is, you can only play this once a day. You may also play up to
      20 to get the Alexandrite(10,000G) or 30 to get the Pink Diamond(10,000G)

8.) Instant Millionaire (needs codebreaker codes)
    - Want to be an instant millionaire in just one day? Use the CODEBREAKER
      CODES in the later part of this guide and pick the cheat wherein specific
      Items are put in your rucksack. Fill all 8 slots of you L.Rucksack with
      Mythic Stones. That alone is worth 160,000G! Just keep reloading and
      reloading the cheats and you'll have an infinite number of Mythic stones
      for shipping. I myself got to 2 millionG in a single day!

+Character Events+

Just as there are Heart events with the bachelorettes(later part of the guide),
you also have character events. I don't have the exact schedules of all of them
since I'm still trying to make good friends with the people. If you can't see
the event, it's either the weather is wrong or you haven't made good enough
friends with the people around you. Also, I don't know how many events each
character has so don't ask me. Some events involve two people so I may have
repetitive schedules with two characters. If you have additions/corrections,
e-mail me and I'll credit you. WARNINGS: Spoilers ahead!

How to know if you're good friends:

1.) Change in the way he/she talks to you(for most characters)
2.) Allows you in the house/shop as early as 6AM(for some characters only)
3.) Allows you in rooms previously locked before
4.) Gives you a birthday card during your birthday(mailbox; for some characters)
5.) Gives you recipes (for most characters)


Name:    Schedule/Events:

Whack-A-Mole
- Anytime; Have tillable soil
  If you have soil to till, prepare a hoe and a hammer (preferably, have only
  those two tools in your rucksack). Till the soil. Once you see a mole,
  quickly switch to the hammer (L+B) and whack it. A tally will appear in your
  Memo screen, along with the records for Harvest Sprite and Dog Disk scores.

Free Horse
- Spring; 1st yr; Your farm
  You have to talk to Barley first when you explore the town. The next day
  or so, he comes to your farm and offers you a horse. Take care of it well
  or else he takes it back.

Goodbye Horse(?)
- A year after you're given the horse; Neglect the horse
  If your horse has 6 or lower hearts, Barley will take it away from you
  and won't return it until the next year. Let that be a lesson to you.

Magnificent Stallion
- A year after you're given the horse; Take good care of your horse
  If you've taken really good care of your horse (if possible 8+ hearts),
  Barley will come over to look at him. He'll be impressed at how healthy
  the stallion is and seeing as how it seems to be so fond of you, decides
  to have it live with you forever.

Animal Death
- Anytime; Neglect your farm animals; Death by natural causes
  If you neglect your animals (aka not feed them), they will eventually
  get sick and die. You'll see a scene wherein Carter holds a funeral service
  for your animal, with either or both Rick and Barley bawling you out for
  your negligence. But if the animals die by natural causes (age), Rick and
  Barley will sympathize.

Sick Little Doggy
- Anytime; Have 0 hearts for your dog
  If your dog has absolutely no love for you, he'll get sick. You take him
  to Doctor, who'll do the best he can though he's not a vet. You're dog
  won't die, but the doc will tell you to take better care of it.

The Fishing Rod
- Spring; 1st yr; 11AM-4PM; Zack's House
  Have an empty tool slot. Just go in. Zack will tell you some stuff and
  he'll give you the fishing rod for free.

Catch the Kappa
- Anytime; Mother's Hill Lake
  Fish on the left side of the lake and you'll probably catch this creature.
  You may also see him by putting in some cucumbers. Once you fish him, he
  will do a spinny dance and disappear.

4:44AM TV
- Again, this is hard to trigger without a clock. Turn on your TV at exactly
  4:44AM and you're game will freeze for a while as the channels zoom past
  your screen until you reach a blank fuzzy screen. Weird. This can be
  triggered several times. In the farm house only.

Midnight Mirror
- For this, you have to have a mirror and a clock in your Farm house.
  At exactly 0:00AM, check your clock first. Then, check out the right and
  left side of your mirror until some weird force pushes you away. Do this
  all over again and you'll hear a door slam. Creepy! Might be the ghost
  of that dead farmer!!!

Won's Arrival
- Spring 3; 1st yr; the minute you step out of your house
  A strange salesman will be at your doorstep. He'll introduce himself as
  Won and explain a bit about himself, his job and where you can find him.
  He will come by once every season to sell you his wares(Vase, Special apples)

Popuri's Mail Order
 - Spring 10-17; Zack's House
   Popuri will walk in and ask Zack if her package has arrived. She'll tell
   you it's a surprise gift for her mom, whose birthday is coming soon
  (Spring 19). Popuri will ask you to keep it a secret. Promise you won't tell
   and she'll be happy. This also raises your friendship with Popuri and Zack.

Carter's Answered Prayer
- Church; Any time
  Go in the church. Carter will tell you that while he was in the confessional,
  he heard a voice say that the thing he wanted will come soon. Later, Zack
  enters the church and confirms this. What is it? It's a secret. Hehe...

Unappreciated Gotz
 - 11AM-4PM; Gotz's House; Don't be friends w/ Gotz
   Triggered only if you're not good friends with Gotz. Visit him and he says
   he doesn't want to work for your farm anymore because he feels unappriciated.
   You'll just have to give him honey everyday to get him to like you.

Harvest Sprites Tea Party
- Spring; 10AM-5PM; Be good friends with H.Sprites; Have invitation
  If you're good friends with the sprites (at least 3 hearts each), you'll get
  an invitation in the mail for a tea party. Bring the invitation to their hut.
  Only works in Spring, 10AM-5PM and if none of them are working for you.

Won's Golden Service
- Probably Spring of 1st yr; 11AM-4PM; Zack's House
  Zack and Won will greet you in. Karen suddenly comes in and Won gets a bit
  of crush on her. He announces that it's "Golden Service Time", where you can
  get anything for free. Karen takes something and leaves but when you try to
  get in the "Golden Service", Won says it's over. What a prick...

Mistaken Bloodtype
- Tuesday; 1:20PM-4PM; Clinic
  Jeff is shocked to learn that his bloodtype was different from what he
  originally thought. Doctor explains that it may have been a clerical error
  and apologizes.

Jeff and Sasha's Childhood Romance
- Tuesday; 11AM-1PM; Poultry Farm House
  Lillia and Sasha talk about Jeff. You learn a little more of Sasha and
  Jeff's childhood...er...romance here.

Stu's Fever
- Wednesday; 10AM-1PM; Ellen's house
  Elli and Ellen are worried over Stu since he has a fever. They'll ask you to
  take him to the doctor. Once in the clinic, you'll find out Stu only has a
  cold. Then, you go back home.

Love Letter
- Wednesday; 9:30AM-1PM; Ellen's House
  Ellen, Elli and Stu welcome you in. Elli starts looking for a book and finds
  an old letter in the pages. It's from her grandfather to her grandmother.
  Ellen reads it. It's a sweet letter and she reminisces.

Stu's Hyperactivity
- Wednesday; 10AM-5PM; Ellen's House; Good friends w/ Stu
  Enter Ellen's house. Stu will ask his grandma to read him a story but when he
  sees you, he's all excited. He looks up to you like a big brother and asks you
  to play with him. If you agree, you'll get out by 7PM with little energy so
  you better do everything you need to do before triggering this event.

Gotz's Painful Memories
 - 11AM-1PM; Gotz's House
   Harris and Gotz will be talking. You'll learn that Gotz once had a wife and
   daughter who died in the mountains *sniff*. No wonder he's moody.

Doctor's Childhood
- Sunny Wednesday; 8AM-10AM; Mother's Hill
  The doctor will be thinking about something. You come up to him and he tells
  you a bit about himself, how he once rebelled against his parents(his father,
  a doctor and his mom, a nurse) because they didn't give him enough time.
  Now that he was a doctor, he understood them and wished he hadn't rebelled
  as much.

Worried Mother
- Any Sunny Day expt. Saturday; Before Fall Winery Harvest; 1PM-4PM; Rose Square
  Walk to Rose Square from the south (eg from Yodel Farm) Manna, Anna and Sasha
  are talking. Manna says she is worried about her daughter, Aja, and wishes
  that she would come home. Anna and Sasha assure her that they'll help her and
  Manna will become happy again.

Harris and Barley's Conversation
- Sunday morning; Yodel Farm House
  Harris talks with Barley about the town and his job.

Doug vs. Duke
- Saturday; 1PM-4PM; Doug's Inn; Rainy(?)
  Duke and Doug are having a fight. Ann tries to stop them but they won't
  listen. Ann asks you to intervene. Break up the fight to gain the respect
  of other people who are also at the inn. When you stop them, Duke & Doug

  her again and Popuri tells him of a lovely necklace up for sale and asks if
  he wants to see it (way to go being subtle). Kai asks if it's expensive and

+Bet You Didn't Know+

Here are some not so well-known (and some, known) facts about the residents of
Mineral Town: WARNINGS: Spoilers ahead!

- Ann's mom died on the fifth of Fall. Try going in Doug's inn on this day and
  he won't be available 'coz he's sulking off on the summit of Mother's Hill.
- Gotz once had a wife and a daughter who died in the mountains. That's why he
  takes it upon himself to make patrols. Maybe that's also why he can be grumpy.
- Aja, Manna and Duke's daughter, from whom the winery was named after,
  ventured off from this simple town to strike it big in the city.
  Duke calls her long-distance a lot. Also, if you marry Ann, Manna will want
  Cliff to marry Aja instead.
- Barley's daughter, Joanna, left May with him. She has yet to return. Barley
  often asks her to come back for May but she wouldn't, saying she's too busy.
  What a bitch...
- Zack is in love with Lillia! You see, Rod, Lillia's husband, found Zack in
  one of his trips and gave him a job at Mineral Town as a shipper. He fell in
  love with Lillia but his loyalty to Rod stopped him from doing anything about
  it. See his house and investigate the photos by the bed.
- A man named Louis once lived in Gotz's house. Gotz says he's a bug-collector
  or something. Louis can be found in the playstation game, Harvest Moon: Back
  to Nature and in Gamecube, Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life.
- The doctor once rebelled against his parents because they never gave him
  enough time. His mom was a nurse and his dad was a doctor. Now that he was a
  doctor himself, he understood why they were so busy.
- The doctor's name, as far as I've heard, is Tim.
- The doctor and Harris grew up together and are actually good friends though
  we never get to see them talk to each other or anything.
- As kids, Duke used to bully Jeff a lot. He would hide behind Sasha and Sasha
  would be the one to protect him (who wears the pants in the family now?).
- Rod, Lillia's husband, has been searching for a permanent cure for his wife's
  illness by going off to the desert. He hasn't returned yet but he often
  writes to Lillia.
- Elli & Stu's grandpa, Ellen's husband, was a very shy man. So shy in fact,
  that he hides his love letters in places that would take years to find and
  even in it, it's clear that he's embarrassed.
- Saibara is in love with Ellen! LOL! He visits her at times.
- Saibara, Ellen and Barley, the three elderlies of the town, grew up together.
- Cliff left his hometown to strike it on his own. When he came back, his
  mother had died and his sister has gone off somewhere. Mineral Town reminds
  him of his old town just as Ann reminds him of his sister.
- Harris, Mayor Thomas's son, is in love with Aja, Duke and Manna's daughter.
  Too bad she now lives in the city.

XV. AMOURE:

Love is in the air! Harvest Moon is one of the few games wherein you can
actually get married and start a family! Unlike previous Harvest Moon games,
the girls of Mineral Town are much harder to win over. What's more challenging
is that you have rivals and there are also some heart events which makes wooing
your girl all the more worth it.


+Marriage+

   <<Main Requirements>>

   1.) Red Heart
   2.) Must witness all Heart Events
   3.) Big House
   4.) Big Bed (Hehe...what else for?)
   5.) Blue Feather (used for proposing)


+The Bachelorettes+

   1.) Ann
   2.) Elli
   3.) Karen
   4.) Mary
   5.) Popuri
   6.) Harvest Goddess


+Take Your Pick+

First of all, you have to choose a girl. If you can't decide, you can try
giving them all gifts everyday and pick the one whose heart level goes up
earlier(that is if you want to get married earlier). If not, you just gotta be
patient and know your girl well. Talk to her as often as you can, know her
schedules and her tastes. If you're a beginner, you can try going for Karen
since she's easier to get than most girls. It gets a bit harder going past the
blue heart though.


+Tips for an early marriage+

This allowed me to get married as early as the 1st year.

1.) Talk to your girl EVERYDAY perhaps twice a day
2.) If possible, GIFT-WRAP your gifts before giving it to a girl
3.) Give gifts to your girl EVERYDAY perhaps twice a day
    (you can have simple gifts then)
4.) Give your girl *SPECIAL GIFTS at least ONCE A WEEK
5.) If you have the money, you can try giving your girl *SPECIAL GIFTS EVERYDAY

*Special gifts are Jewelry, Perfume, Dresses, Sun Block, Lotion, Face Mask AND
 things she LOVES. Other specialty items are Queen of the Night, Plant
  Encyclopedia & Band-Aid

Final note: tip#4 really helped me a lot. I had Saibara make jewelry for me on
a Wednesday and take it on a Friday (Friday's my special day. Plus, Saibara's
closed on Thursdays), gift wrap it and give it to my girl. And so I got to
marry really early in the game. It may cost you some, but if you want an early
marriage, this is the way to go.


+Heart Levels+

When you meet the eligible bachelorettes, you recognize them immediately since
there's a small beating heart on their chest. You start off with black but it
will eventually change color as the girl likes you more and more. The heart
gets bigger too. Here are the different levels:

Color:      What it means:

Black       She doesn't like you.
Purple      She likes you.
Blue        She likes you and considers you a friend.
Green       She considers you a really good friend.
Yellow      She has a bit of a crush on you.
Orange      She has a HUGE crush on you. (Blue Feather available)
Red         She loves you enough to marry you.


+Proposing+

To propose to a girl, you must get a Blue Feather. You'll get a letter in the
mail if it's available or not so check your mailbox but you don't have to.
Just check the supermarket from time to time or when you see a girl with an
Orange heart. You can only get the Blue Feather once a girl's heart level
is Orange.

How does the supermarket know when to put that in stock? Everyone in Mineral
Town knows everyone else esp. about romances (what do you think the wives who
come to Rose Square are talking about?).

Buy the Blue Feather. It's only 1000G. If you propose without meeting the main
requirements(MARRIAGE SECTION), she will think it's a joke or say that she
can't marry you or thinks of you only as a friend.

If and when she says yes, you'll get married a week later.


+Becoming Parents+

Once you get married, you'll notice that only your wife will have a beating
heart on her chest. The rest of the girls will, of course, be unavailable now.
That means you'll still have to maintain your wife's heart level so that she
will eventually get pregnant. To do this, just give her gifts and talk to her
everyday. If you can maintain ten hearts, she gets pregnant one season after
your marriage. She'll then give birth two seasons later to a baby boy, who
could one day, help you around the farm.

The baby boy will eventually grow up too and you'll see his heart level on the
EARNINGS/MAIN MENU. To boost his heart level, give him gifts (particularly
honey, chocolate, apple, milk and strawberry milk) and talk to him everyday.
Eventually, he'll be big.

Unlike the Harvest Moon game in SNES and GB/color however, this time, you only
get one kid. I would've wanted to have two, a boy and a girl but guess it ain't
possible. In HM in SNES, you get two sons. Last time, I got my second
son one season after my first son was born (really quick, huh?) and I got
a third son too! I got three kids!


+Staying Married+

Unlike in HM: Back to Nature (PS Game basis for Mineral Town), this time,
there's no divorce in FoMT. But still you wouldn't want your wife to hate you
now, would you? Well, first thing, never neglect or cheat on your wife.
Continue to give her gifts and monitor the number of hearts she has on the
MAIN MENU. Maintain 10 hearts if possible. If she goes down to a blue heart,
she'll start to hate you. And don't neglect your child either.
Don't forget birthdays and anniversaries. If you stay married for 50 years,
Gotz builds you a Mountain Cottage. What a perk!


+Girls+

This will probably be my most detailed section ever since I just love
this part! It's where you can find details on the eligible maidens in town.

*Special Gifts (all girls): Necklace, Bracelet, Earrings, Broach, Dress,
                            Perfume, Skin Lotion, Face Mask, Sun Block,
                            Queen of the Night, Plant Encyclopedia, Band-Aid

***************************
Ann
***************************
Ann lives at her father's inn (Doug's Inn). She's sort of a tomboy and dresses
in overalls...like you! She's a very nice girl who likes cooking and helping
her dad out at the inn. She's my particular favorite since Harvest Moon in
SNES and has become my fave girl in this game, mostly 'coz she has the
sweetest heart events among all the girls and she says some great stuff once
you get her heart level up higher.

            the winnery job to Cliff so that he'll leave town and you won't

Elli is the nurse at the Clinic/Hospital in Mineral Town. She works there with

to notice her. Elli takes care of her little brother Stu. When the Clinic is

Karen
***************************
Karen is probably the prettiest girl in town. With long blonde hair, even the
salesman Won has a crush on her (shudders...). She is the daughter of Jeff and
Sasha, who run the supermarket. She likes to drink...A LOT. She's probably the
only girl in town who drinks that much. She is also Rick's best friend.
And she sings pretty good (I dunno if it's because of the liquor).
She hates sweets and can't cook to save her life. Probably the easiest
girl to get.

Rival:     Rick
Tip:       In spring, give her bamboo shoots everyday if you can't afford the
           wine. She loves them a whole lot and she'll quickly fall in love
           with you. Buying stuff from the supermarket also increases her
           heart level so even if you’re not wooing her, don’t be surprised to
           find her heart level up quicker than most girls since of course,
           you shop constantly.

Mary is the nerdy girl. She reads a lot, wears glasses and is the town
librarian. She is the daughter of botanist and author, Basil, and his wife,
Anna. She loves books and makes the library her life. But don't worry. The
library isn't boring at all. It's incredibly useful, in fact. Mary likes it
when you visit often to read.

Rival:     Gray
Tip:       In spring, give her bamboo shoots everyday. She loves them a whole
           lot. Visiting the library often also boosts her heart level.
           She's the girl with the cheapest and easiest ways of getting
           since her likes are practically found everywhere and are mostly
           for free(medicinal herbs/grasses/crops)

Popuri
***************************
Popuri is the town's childish girly girl. She's pretty and bubbly. She lives
with her mother, Lillia and her over-protective brother, Rick. They run a
Poultry farm. She's almost always happy but can be moody at times especially
when people baby her. She loves eggs and sweets and hates adult dogs.

            Pink Diamond, Amethyst, Ruby, Topaz, Emerald
Rival:      Kai
Tip:        Popuri's a nice choice if you're worried about your rivals since
            Kai only comes during Summer. You have the rest of the 3 seasons
            to get her. Just give her eggs everyday and she'll like you quick.
            Becoming friends with her brother, Rick, and her mother, Lillia, is
            also a good way of boosting her heart level. If you plan on
            marrying her in the 4th year or later, don't go to the beach
            during summer to prevent any rival heart events between her and Kai
            (except for the Beach Day and Fireworks Festival of course)

Harvest Goddess
***************************
Like all the girls, you can also marry the ever lovely Harvest Goddess.
But if you think you can do it quick, you're dead wrong! Though you're a
master or not, I wouldn't recommend going for this girl. She requires way too
much stuff and when you get married, she mostly leaves you alone and only
appears when your baby events take place. There's no heart event and you can't
even see her heart level. Really not worth the trouble but if you're an absolute
perfectionist or for some reason you fell madly in love with her, knock
yourself out.

+Information+

Address:    Harvest Goddess Spring (throw things in to make her appear)
Birthday:   Spring 8th (Spring 9th)
Likes:      Pineapples, Eggs, Flowers (doesn't like those special gifts)
Rival:      none (maybe Carter? or the Kappa? Hehe...)
Tip:        Don't go after this girl. If you wish to propose to her, go to the
            spring and use the blue feather (she can be bitchy with her answer)

+Schedule+

NONE

+Requirements+ (like I said. Knock yourself out silly)

1.) Catch one of every species of fish
2.) Ship one of everything
3.) Have all 9 Goddess Gems
4.) Have all 9 Kappa Gems
5.) Have big bed
6.) Dig up every kind of item from Spring Mine
7.) Dig up every kind of item from Winter/Lake Mine
8.) Be in fifth year or later
9.) Confess to Carter that you want to marry the Harvest Goddess
10.)Must have Vase. Buy it from Won when he comes to your farm.

+Extra ways+

1.) Walk 10,000, 100,000, 1,000,000, etc. steps with Pedometer
2.) Ship 10,000, 100,000, 1,000,000, etc. of one thing
3.) Catch 10,000, 100,000, 1,000,000, etc. of the same fish
4.) Dig down to floors 100, 200, & 225 of Spring Mine(Only works on the first
                                                                        time)


+Heart Events+

These are the cut scenes that happen at certain times once you get a girl's
heart level up higher. WARNING: Spoilers ahead!

***************************
Ann
***************************

+Black+
- Any day bet. 10:40AM-1PM; Doug's Inn
- Walk into the inn. Ann will welcome you and have her dad give you a free meal.
  Agree to have the meal and she and Doug will be delighted. Of course, Doug
  says it's only free the first time.

+Purple+
- Any day bet. 10:30AM-1PM or 4PM-7PM; 2nd floor at Doug's Inn
- You'll see Ann cleaning and singing. You walk up to her and she gets startled.
  She gets mad at you for a second but forgives you and asks if you like
  cleaning. Say yes and she likes you even more.

+Blue+ (must have L. Rucksack and an empty slot in Rucksack)
- Mon/Fri; 12PM-7PM; Doug's Inn
- Ann will be complaining to her dad about a tummy ache. Doug panics and asks
  you what to do. HINT: DO NOT PANIC! The next scene will be at the clinic and
  you find out Ann just had a case of indigestion because she ate A LOT. The
  next scene would be in Ann's room, where she talks to you (and if you picked
  the right answer before), she thanks you for your concern and gives you a
  broken music box.

+Yellow+
- Wed, Thu, Sat, Sun; 10AM-7PM; Doug's Inn
- Doug welcomes you in. He tells you he wants to talk about Ann. He says that
  he wants to find a good husband for her and reveals that Ann never talked
  about boys until you came along. Now, she talks about you all the time.
  Doug will then ask what you think of her. If you say only as a friend, the
  conversation ends there. But if you say you like her, Doug will say that he
  is relieved. Ann comes in and asks what's up. Doug calls for Ann to stand
  beside you. Ann is baffled and when Doug asks what she thought about
  you(and in front of you,mind you. I'd just die if that happened to me!),
  she tells him it's none of his business and goes away embarrassed. KAWAII!

***************************
Elli
***************************

+Black+
- Any day; Any time; Clinic
- Stu is in the clinic with Elli. Stu shows her a bug and Elli freaks out.
  She scolds Stu. Stu says that you understand him because you're both boys.
  Say 'not really'. Oh, he cries but Elli is happier that someone else
  reprimanded her bratty brother.

+Purple+
- Thu/Sat/Sun; 9AM-6:59PM; Clinic
- Elli greets you in. Jeff suddenly rushes
  inside and complains of a stomach ache. The doctor tells Elli to bring some
  medicine but she brought the wrong one. She quickly fixed the situation but
  is discouraged. Tell her she'll make a great nurse and she'll be happy.

+Blue+ (must have L. Rucksack and an empty slot in Rucksack)
- Wednesday; 12PM-1PM; Ellen's house
- Ellen and Elli welcome you to the house. Elli is sad because Stu ran off.
  He didn't want to eat the food Elli made for him. They ask you to look for
  Stu and if you agree, you'll instantly be by the church. You convince Stu
  to come home. Once there, Elli thanks you and gives you a pressed flower.

+Yellow+
- Wednesday; 9AM-6PM; Mineral Beach
- Elli is standing on the dock. She asks if you think it's unusual for her
  to be there but then explains that her family used to go there when her
  parents were still alive. She goes there when she has a lot on her mind and
  today, she's worried that she's not raising Stu well enough. She asks what
  you think. Tell her that she's doing a great job and you mostly get an
  Orange heart. She thanks you for boosting her confidence.

***************************
Karen
***************************

+Black+
- Wed/Fri; 10AM-1PM; Supermarket
- Karen will welcome you to her store. She says how hard it must be for you
  in the farm and asks if you could use some help. Say yes and she goes to
  her dad and asks him to give you a bag of grass seeds free. Jeff starts
  to protest but Karen tells him they should share. You then receive the
  grass seeds free of charge.

+Purple+
- Any day except Tue & Sun; 10AM-1PM; Supermarket
- Karen has an argument with her mother. Karen wants to send her cousin one
  kind of flower seeds while Sasha wants to send her another. They ask Jeff for
  his opinion but he didn't want to get involved with the fight between his wife
  and daughter. So, they ask you to help decide. Side with Karen and she'll like
  you more.

+Blue+
- Any day; 10AM-1PM; Supermarket
- Karen and Duke are having a conversation. Karen seems happy. You learn that
  Karen's dad had asked Duke to make some wine the day Karen was born and they
  ask you to help Karen go pick it up. Say yes. Later, you find out there isn't
  one, but several cases of wine. After helping gather all of them, Karen gives
  you a bottle as thanks.

+Green+ (not exactly a Heart Event but it IS a major factor)
- Sunday; 7PM-10PM; Doug's Inn
- Karen is in a heated argument with Duke. Duke had run a tab at the
  supermarket and refused to pay. Karen challenges him to a drinking match.
  If he lost, he'd have to pay. Duke agrees and Karen asks you to be the judge.
  Say yes (you may get a yellow heart if you're lucky). Later, Karen wins and
  she goes home on her own, a bit drunk. You'll have to take Duke home
  yourself since he's wasted. Once in the winery, Manna will scold Duke and you
  sneak out of the house.

+Yellow+
- Mon, Thu, Sat; 10AM-1PM; Supermarket
- Karen happily announces that her new dish is done. She wants her parents to
  taste it but they try to pass (too many bad past experiences). When they see
  you, they immediately tell you to be Karen's food taster. It's risky but if
  you like her, you'll have to say yes. Mostly, you'll get an Orange heart for
  this. She'll show you to the back of her house where you eat the food,
  collapse, and wind up in the hospital. Karen wonders if it you may have been
  sick and had not noticed it. She promised to cook more food to make you feel
  better. The doctor is speechless.

***************************
Mary
***************************

+Black+
- Any day except Monday; 10AM-1PM; Library
- Mary is thinking so hard about something, she didn't see you and almost
  bumped into you. She apologizes, saying that she had a lot on her mind.
  Ask her if you could help and she'll talk about it and stuff like that.

+Purple+
- Thu, Sat, Sun; 10AM-4PM; Library
- Mary is looking for a book. You come up to her and she is startled for a
  second. She explains that she is looking for a book that she is using as
  reference to her new novel. She asks you to help her find it. Say yes.
  Later, you find it and she thanks you.

+Blue+ (must have L. Rucksack and empty slot in rucksack)
- Monday; 12AM-5PM; Summit of Mother's Hill
- Mary is crying while reading a book. She is surprised to find you there and
  she explains that she likes to read in a place with a good view.
  She asks you if you cry when you read. Say sometimes. She's happy to hear
  that and gives you the book.

+Yellow+
- Mon; 10AM-1PM; In her house
- Basil and Manna are confused with Mary's strange behavior. They see you and
  ask that you talk to her on the second floor. There, Mary says that she's
  just thinking of a plot for her new book. When she asks you for ideas,
  you'll be given three choices. Pick a story about your farm. She'll think
  it's an excellent idea and asks you several questions. WARNING! You must do
  everything you need to do before triggering this event since it will take
  you until 6PM to answer all her questions.

***************************
Popuri
***************************

+Black+
- Wed/Fri; 10AM-6PM; Poultry Farm; As you exit from the Blacksmith shop
- A chicken will run at you and you will catch it. Popuri will thank you and
  ask if you like chickens. Say yes and she'll be happy.

+Purple+
- Any day excpt. Sunday; 6AM-12PM, at your farm, the minute you step out the
  door
- Popuri arrives unexpectedly at your house. She asks you for a tour of your
  farm. Say yes and you go with the tour. The tour will be done by 1PM. She
  later thanks you. You usually get a blue heart after that.

+Blue+
- All seasons except Summer; Sunny Sunday; 10AM-1PM; Church
- Go inside the church. May will want to play "house" with Stu as her brother,
  Popuri as the mother and Carter as the father but Carter says he's too busy.
  He asks you to play the father. Say yes and you'll be by the hot springs.
  Later, Popuri gives you a mud ball.

+Yellow+
- Any sunny day except Tue & Sun; 11:20AM-1PM; Poultry Farmhouse
- Go in the house. Popuri and Rick will be fighting about their dad. Side with
  Popuri and you'll mostly get an orange heart.

+Rival Weddings+

Seven days after the rival's Orange Heart event is triggered, your rival will
get married to the respective girl. You can be invited to the wedding or not
at all. Note that the wedding invitation DOESN'T APPEAR ON YOUR MAIL unlike
in real life. On the day of the wedding, the rival will come to your doorstep
and invite you. You won't be able to do any activities on that specific day
(and you don't have a choice on whether you attend or not either. Sorry)

*How to get invited:

1.) Become good friends with your rival
2.) You must sleep the night before the wedding. Don't work non-stop.
3.) Be at your farm house and never at the other 3 houses

If you don't get invited, you can "gate crash" by going to the church from
6AM-10PM on the wedding day. Carter will invite you to celebrate.
If you accept, you won't be able to do any activities and only wake up the
next day. If you decline, you'll be able to talk to everyone in the church,
even the bride and groom. Your rival will give you some crap of a reason as to
why he didn't invite you...hehehe....

XVI. KITCHEN CASSANOVA:

One of the most important things to have in your house (at least to me) is the
kitchen. You'll have to buy the kitchen and every single one of the kitchen
utensils from the T.V. Shopping network. Once you get them all, you can make
some great dishes.

Cooking your own dishes is fun. It allows you to enter the Cooking Festival
and participate in the Spring Thanksgiving Festival. Also, cooking food for
the girls and people make them like you more.

+Cooking Requirements+
- Kitchen
- Mixer
- Whisk
- Oven
- Frying Pan
- Rolling Pin
- Knife
- Seasoning Set
- Pot

To cook, simply investigate your kitchen and whip them dishes good!


+Cook Book+

These are the recipes which I've learned over experimenting and making friendly
with the people around you. All these dishes, I try to modify to the point of
giving you the most stamina and recovery from fatigue. I've even won Cooking
Festivals because of this! It may cost some, but it's worth it. Send
additions/corrections to my e-mail.

XVII. BREAKING THE CODES:

These are just some of my favorite codebreaker codes. You can find many more
through the internet. I dunno if all these work since I only use an emulator.
But so far, all these worked for me. ALL VBA USERS, if the code begins with a
zero, change that into 8. Also, I don't know how well these will work or what
glitches they may bring so be careful! If you encounter a glitch or if it
doesn't work, e-mail me. BTW, GBA USERS, if the code begins with an 8, turn it
into a zero. I'm not sure if that works well though...

Oh, and a bit of note. For GBA users, you can buy a codebreaker from
Toys 'R Us or from your local videogames shop. To VBA users, read the
instructions here carefully, as I will no longer answer e-mails that
ask for a step-by-step guide on how to activate the codes. It is already
stated here and it's already a step-by-step method.

e.g. GBA: 0XXXXXXX
     VBA: 8XXXXXXX

Instructions (GBA Codebreaker):

1. Have a saved game file
2. Activate codes and turn GBA on
3. Turn off Codebreaker
4. Load your saved game file
5. Once you are able to move around, turn Codebreaker back on


Instructions (VBA Codebreaker):
*Only VBA users with version 1.7.2 up can access codebreaker.

1. After starting your new game, save in the diary
2. Load the saved file from the diary
3. Reset the game and click on continue
4. Load your saved game file
5. Once you are able to move around, activate or load your cheats

GIFT WRAP - gift wrapping costs 100G per gift but it adds 125% to the original
            "affection" value of the gift. The same is true if the person
            dislikes the item. It slashes 125% and he/she may hate you more so
            be careful! To gift wrap, just add +2 to the last digit of the code.

+E-mailing Queries+

First Note: Due to the numerous SPAM mail that I've been getting, I am no
longer using my old e-mail. I am using a new one that I don't prominently
display.

hmUNDERSCOREgwendyATyahooDOTcomDOTph

When I wrote this guide, I never really expected that I'd have any responses.
So, you can imagine my shock and surprise when BOOM!!! I get nearly 30
e-mails a day!!! Being that I have so many jobs (esp. handling e-mails from
my fansites, yada yada yada), I really don't think I can handle everything
at once. So, I decided to put some very simple rules when it comes to
e-mailing me. Please read carefully. If I don't respond to your e-mail,
it's either I'm super busy or it got lost somewhere in the caverns of my
mountains of e-mail. I'm sorry if I can't respond but you have to understand
that I have to live my own life too...

1.) Try your best NOT to e-mail me questions that are already answered in
    the guide. Just review the guide esp. the FAQs. Otherwise, you'll
    either not receive a reply from me or I'll just simply say something
    like "Check the guide for further details".

2.) I used to be alright with this at first, but now, I find myself too
    busy for people who want to be constant e-pals and such. I like
    making friends and all, but I don't think I can give you a quick
    response with your every e-mail.

3.) Try not to ask me where you can download the rom for FOMT or where
    you can download VBA. Search in Google.com or read the FAQs.

4.) Try not to ask me the step by step guide on how to use the Codebreaker
    (for both GBA and VBA) since I already have it here.


+F.A.Q.s+

I'll try to answer as many questions as I can. If you have questions,
e-mail me and I'll try my best to answer them.
These are all arranged randomly. You will not be credited for your
question, as most of them are sent in by numerous people.
FAQS are now arranged according to subject.

<<Girls, Marriage and Family>>

  Q: How come girls have alternate birthdays and not the villagers?
  A: You can't have the same birthdays as the girls. It's pre-programmed
     because if/when you get married, there are birthday events and you can't
     have the same celebrations. If you pick the same birthdays, they'll have
     those alternate birthdays.

  Q: I can't trigger my girl's heart events and she's already at
     a higher color level.
  A: This one happened a lot to me. Actually, the girl's affection
     rate for you CAN fluctuate, meaning, she can like you or
     hate you the next. It depends on the things you do so be
     careful and maintain her affection for you by doing things or
     giving her things she likes. Once, I triggered Ann's Purple
     heart event three times! The reason? I kept giving her Blue
     Grass and sometimes Chocolate, which lowered and raised her
     heart level simultaneously. This fluctuation may cause the
     "un-triggering" of events since it tends to confuse the game.
     Some events (like Popuri's Sunday events, which doesn't happen
     in summer) will only be triggered in certain seasons or years.
     Events won't be triggered during festivals. Another thing would
     be if you picked the wrong answer in a previous heart event so
     be careful with your answers! Also, check and remember her
     schedules from the HEART EVENTS section.

  Q: My girl has a red heart but she still won't marry me when I propose!
  A: You have to meet all the requirements. See MARRIAGE section for details.

  Q: Is it true that if I marry Popuri, she'll help me in the farm?
  A: It's a myth. Popuri won't help you in the farm. The same goes
     for Rick too, in HM: FoMT for girls and HM: More Friends of Mineral Town.

  Q: We've been married like forever but my wife still won't get pregnant.
  A: Give her gifts everyday and monitor the number of hearts she has.
     Maintain 10 and she'll soon be pregnant. Just be patient. The earliest
     time for her to get pregnant is exactly one season after your wedding.
     However, if you used cheats for instant marriage and max. affection,
     she'll get pregnant w/in the week. See BREAKING THE CODES.

  Q: I have a son now. Can I have another kid?
  A: I wished and wished for this to happen but the game only allows you
     one kid. Harvest Moon in SNES allows you to have as many as three.

  Q: Can I have a daughter?
  A: No, you can't. You can only have a daughter in HM: FoMT for girls
     or HM: More Friends of Mineral Town.

  Q: How old does my son have to be for him to help around the farm?
  A: Truth be told, I don't really know. My own son's still two years old and
     he's still walking around the house. I can't even pick him up! I'll give
     a proper answer once I get him to a few more years. I've heard your son
     won't help you until he is 10 years old.

<<Rivals>>

  Q: Cliff left! How do I get him back?
  A: Sorry, you can’t. You should’ve picked him for the job at the winery.
     See CHARACTER EVENTS for further details.

  Q: I'm married now and am in the fourth year of the game. How come the girls
     didn't get married with their respective partners?
  A: First, you have to trigger all of the rival heart events. The events
     will not be triggered if the girl likes you better than your rival
     (e.g. if girl has green heart for you and only blue for the rival).
     The best way to go (unless you want all the other girls to go celibate) is
     to choose only one girl and forget about the others.

  Q: How do I get invited to a rival's wedding?
  A: Be good friends with your rival. For more details, check RIVAL WEDDINGS.

  Q: Can your rival have children with their respective wives?
  A: Apparently, not, which is strange. I think all the other guys might
     be impotent or infertile. Your wife is lucky! LOL!

<<People of Mineral Town>>

  Q: I asked Gotz to expand something for me but he stopped.
  A: Give Gotz honey everyday (esp. while he's working).

  Q: Gotz won't work for me! He says he doesn't have the creative urge.
  A: Gotz won't work for you if you're not friends with him. Give him
     honey everyday to get him to like you and work for you.

  Q: Is Carter German?
  A: Maybe he is. He speaks German if you ask him to harvest grapes
     with you for the winnery on the 14th of Autumn in the first year.

  Q: How do I get to the back of Carter's church?
  A: Be good friends with him. An event will be triggered by autumn, which
     unlocks the door. See CHARACTER EVENTS.

  Q: How do I get the Harvest Sprites to be friends with me?
  A: The cheapest way is by giving each of them flour everyday.
     Once they have 3 hearts of friendship for you, they'll play with
     you and/or work for you. I could suggest giving them a grass
     with corresponding colors, but it's like you're giving away
     twice of what the flour is worth so stick with flour since
     it's only 50G. Gift-wrapping the flour makes a HUGE difference
     so I suggest you do so.

<<Animals>>

  Q: How do I know that my dog is all grown up?
  A: His head is bigger and his red collar is gone.

  Q: How can I use the frisbee to play with my dog?
  A: Go to Mineral beach with your adult dog and your frisbee.
     Investigate the sign between Kai's beach house and Zack's house.
     Must be done on sunny days, 6AM-5PM, and never in Winter.

  Q: Can my dog have puppies with May's dog, Hannah? I heard this was true.
  A: It's a myth. You CANNOT have puppies. Now, that's a fact.

  Q: How do I get a horse?
  A: During your first day in the farm, you must talk to Barley from
     Yodel Farm. He'll give you the horse the next day or so(sunny).

  Q: When does my horse grow up?
  A: Grows up by the next year. You must take good care of your horse.

  Q: How do I ride my horse?
  A: You can only do this once you're horse is all grown up. Approach
     it and press A.

  Q: Barley took my horse away! WHY?!
  A: Probably 'coz you neglected it. You'll only get it back by next spring.
     This only happens if your horse has 6 hearts or lower.

  Q: How do I catch the King Fishes?
  A: Watch the Fishing Show every Tuesday in your house.
     They often give subtle clues there.

<<Tools>>

  Q: How do I get a fishing rod?
  A: In the 1st yr, Spring, from 11AM-4PM, go to Zack's house.
     Have an empty tool slot. You'll see a cut scene and he gives you
     the fishing rod free.

  Q: Help! My cursed tool (hammer/sickle)is still cursed and I've
     equipped it for over 10 days! My animals are all dying and I
     can't plant more crops! It's draining me of my energy too!
  A: It's either a glitch, or you had Carter remove the tool so
     you can use other tools. FATAL MISTAKE! You must NEVER have
     Carter bless the C.hammer/sickle since you'll need to have
     it on hand TEN DAYS STRAIGHT. No removal. The best you can
     do for the farm is be friends with the sprites and have
     them do all the work for you while you wait for the ten days
     to be over with.

  Q: I don't have a mythic hammer yet but I'm curious. What's behind
     the big rock in the mountains?
  A: There's a path way there that leads to...nowhere. Just another
     side of the lake. On autumn, you can get a truffle at the
     end or you can fish there for the Kappa in any season.

<<Television>>

  Q: How do I buy the stuff from the TV Shopping network?
  A: Once you see something you like in the TV Shopping network, make a stop
     at Doug's Inn and use the phone. After purchasing the product, you
     won't be able to use the phone until the thing you bought arrives.
     Zack usually delivers it within 2-3 days.

  Q: The TV Shopping network is gone! It's been replaced by St. Emerald's
     Academy! I need to buy some stuff! Where'd it go?
  A: This is one of the most common mistakes a gamer can make. The
     TV Shopping Network shows up on Saturdays and every week, it shows
     up a different product. You should buy what you want or need ASAP
     because after airing its last product (large bed or power berry if
     you bought everything), it will stop airing and will only air
     again next year. Me? I held my breath and forked up everything I
     had just to buy everything and worked twice as hard to get back
     enough cash. Once you're done buying all the products, you can
     definitely relax.

<<How to Get Stuff>>

  Q: How do I get the three different houses?
  A: Get Gotz to build you the Vacation house if you can afford it.
     Get the Villa once you have 42 connectivity stars. Get the Mountain Cottage
     if you stay married for 50 years. Can't wait? Check the BREAKING THE CODES
     section for the cheats.

  Q: How do I get the Red Magic Grass? I can't find it anywhere in Fall.
  A: Buy Magic Seeds from Won and plant A LOT of it. Along some batches will be
     the red ones, which, by the way, is the only shippable flower in the game.

  Q: How do I get the Band-Aid?
  A: It's in a character event (not HEART) for Elli. Something like you have to
     act like a baby or something. I'm yet to experience this event so I
     don't have an exact schedule. However, you can only keep it for yourself
     by using cheats and it is only 'giveable' to potential brides.
     See BREAKING THE CODES.

  Q: How do I get the Plant Encyclopedia?
  A: Trigger Mary's purple heart event. See HEART EVENTS for more details.
     However, you can only keep it for yourself by using cheats and it is only
     'giveable' to potential brides. See BREAKING THE CODES.

  Q: How do I get the Queen of the Night?
  A: Also known as White Flower, this blooms only on summer nights. To get it,
     you must be good friends with Ellen and trigger an event. Go to
     CHARACTER EVENTS for more details. The flower can be found on the same
     day, at 9PM, on the peak of Mother's Hill. However, you can only keep it
     for yourself by using cheats and it is only 'giveable' to
     potential brides. See BREAKING THE CODES.

  Q: How do I get the P & X products (P/X Milk/Wool/Egg)?
  A: You can only get the P Products if your animal (cow/sheep/chicken)
     has 8-10 hearts of affection for you, has won its respective
     festival and has spent 600 game hours outside. X products have
     the same requirement but are rarely produced.

  Q: How do I get the sock for Winter 25th?
  A: Become good friends with Ellen and give her a yarn. Try giving her yarn
     everyday 'til one day, she'll knit a sock for you. If you can't wait,
     just use cheats. Check CHARACTER EVENTS for further details.

  Q: How do I get presents on the Sock Festival? I wake up and find nothing
     in my sock.
  A: You must sleep bet. 9PM-12AM on Winter 25th.

  Q: How do I get the record player?
  A: Connect to Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life. Do this by making an offer to
     the H.Goddess. Once connected, you can buy it from Lou (Ban).
     You can also buy Albums from him. You may also use cheats.

  Q: Where can I get the Makers?
  A: Bring an Adamantite to Saibara's as well as 20,000G for each maker.
     There are three: Mayonnaise, Cheese and Yarn Maker.

<<Other Stuff>>

  Q: What's the purpose of the Golden Lumber? Where do I put it?
  A: This is actually one of the most annoying things in the game and
     my most hated object. Why? Because it has no true purpose...at least,
     not without consequences. Like other lumber, you can put this up
     as a fence and IT NEVER ROTS! Too good to be true. Once you have
     it out, everyone in town will get jealous and they'll all hate
     you, esp. the girls. The best thing to do with it is either keep
     it in your shelf, throw it in the fireplace or simply throw it
     away. Don't give it to people or throw it in the rivers/lakes/seas.

  Q: Help! My basket is gone! Where did it go?!
  A: It could either be a glitch or you left your basket in the mines.
     If not, you can try looking at the town and farm map since it
     appears there. If you lost the basket in the mines, don't worry.
     It'll be brought back to you after 3 days or you could go down
     to the floor you left it in and retrieve it yourself.

  Q: What's the empty lot used for? The one beside Saibara's and above
     the Poultry Farm House?
  A: That's where your Town Cottage or Vacation House will be located,
     once you have enough lumber and money to have Gotz build it.

  Q: What's the importance of gift-wrapping?
  A: Gift-wrapping adds 125% to the affection rate provided by the
     item you are giving to someone (eg if you gift-wrap a spa-boiled
     egg and give it to Ann, she'll like you 125% more than if you
     don't have it gift-wrapped). The same is true if you gift-wrap
     something a person hates and give it to them. It will make them
     HATE you 125% more so be careful with what you gift-wrap.

  Q: Help! I'm in the mines but I can't find the stairs going to the lower
     level!
  A: This happened a lot to me actually. Note that some stairs are hidden
     under the rocks so you'll have to break 'em and dig on the spot.
     If you've broken all the rocks and dug all the soil and still no
     stairs, you'll have no other choice but to go back up. I think this
     was an error during the programming stages of the game which was never
     checked out.

<<Roms, Emulators, Cheats and Codebreaker>>

  Q: Where can I get a Codebreaker?
  A: For VBA (version 1.7.2) users, that is available in the cheats
     option. For actual handheld GBA, you can buy it in your local
     video games shop. I heard you can buy it in Wallmart or
     Toys R' Us.

  Q: How do I use my codebreaker (VBA/GBA)?
  A: Please check BREAKING THE CODES section for further details.

  Q: Where can I download VBA and Harvest Moon FOMT rom/s?
  A: Truth be told, I forgot the exact site where I downloaded mine but I
     got it off searching from http://www.google.com

  Q: The cheats won't work. How come?
  A: Make sure you followed the instructions well. Either that or it just
     doesn't work for you. It happens sometimes. It happens a lot to me to.
     Check out BREAKING THE CODES section for more details.

  Q: How come the H.Goddess isn't married to me? I used the cheats!
  A: She doesn't actually live with you. Like I said. You shouldn't go for
     this girl. Life sucks without your wife at your side, eh? To make sure
     the cheats worked, go to the EARNINGS MENU and see if her tiny 'head' is
     right below yours.

  Q: I used the cheats to get a red heart for <<girl>> but she still won't
     marry me.
  A: Though she has a red heart, you still have to meet the requirements.
     See MARRIAGE section for details.

  Q: I married <<girl>> with the cheats. How come she doesn't get pregnant?
  A: Look at the Main Menu to see if she has 10 hearts. If not, pick the cheat
     to give her a red heart. She'll get pregnant soon.

  Q. I married <<girl>> with the cheats. How come she hates me?
  A: This only happens if you married her instantly when she still has blue and
     lower heart level. You'll have to use the cheats to make her heart level
     red or go out of your way re-courting her...

<<Misc.>>

  Q: Why did you make this guide?
  A: 'Coz back then, I had no purpose in life? No. Hehehe. I love HM games esp.
     FoMT but couldn't find a well-organized guide with everything I wanted so
     I decided to make one.

  Q: Which country are you from?
  A: I'm a true-blue Filipina from the Pearl of the Orient Seas,
     The Philippines.

  Q: Where's your e-mail? I can't find it!
  A: Like I said. My previous e-mails have so much SPAM in it, I decided to
     make a new e-mail for all HM related questions. You can e-mail me now
     at hmUNDERSCOREgwendyATyahooDOTcomDOTph. Sorry for not displaying it
     prominently. It's my feeble attempt to stop SPAM.

  Q: How often do you update this FAQ?
  A: Depends on how busy I am or when I feel like it.

  Q: Do you take fanart requests for Harvest Moon?
  A: No. I only do COMMISSION fanart. Contact me if you want some. I don't
     charge on an hourly basis. I charge per artwork and I charge reasonably.
